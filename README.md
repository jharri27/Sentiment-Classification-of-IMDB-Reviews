Project Description:\

The task for this project was to take a Kaggle dataset containing 156,060 phrases, and to train and test a sentiment classification process, with the goal of attaining the best F1 score, a statistic that represents the harmonic average of the precision and recall of a classifier.  My approach was to build a baseline classifier using a "bag of words" feature, and then try various other classifiers and combinations of classifiers to try to find the best F1 score possible.\
